            <p>"I was in the Army. I joined because I wanted to get out my situation real quick. I was just a kid.</p>
            <p>The military breaks you down in Basic Training. Any personality you have must be gone - shattered. You have to work with so many groups of people that this is what they have to do.</p> 
            <p>Everything becomes instinctive and routine-like. We can not afford hesitation. If we encounter an enemy, we end him. When we wake up, we do the same thing. When we go to sleep, we do the same thing. Every day is the exact same. People talk about the militarization of the police force in this country, but you have to understand that most of those guys are former military. We need a routine like that to function in society again. The unpredictability of civilian life becomes foreign to us.</p>
            <p>After war time, we're given a computerized survey to check our mental health. None of us really took it very seriously. I thought I was alright, maybe a little testier. I just clicked through the questions. I ended up losing grip on reality.</p>
            <p>I would have nightmares. My wife couldn't come in while I was sleeping. The fear of combat sticks with you. Loud noises illicit strong responses within me. One of my friends said "Boo!", and I broke three of his ribs before I knew what I was doing. At one point, I actually thought my child was in physical danger. I woke up after being handcuffed to a hospital bed after trying to kill myself.</p>
            <p>They gave me antidepressants but I didn't like them. The side effects were too harsh. I could be in front of a burning building, and think to myself "Hmm, that's okay." They assigned me 3 counselors, talked to me for a while and did some group therapy, which was nice. But after a while they just handed me a check and an appointment a month later and said "Go away."</p>
            <p>I laugh a lot, and joke around some. I look normal on the outside. But the Army programs you to be a killing machine. I went in as a normal kid, and came out a completely different man. I want to be normal. We all do. After I left the service, nothing mattered to me. I bore no consideration for anyone else because in my mind all I needed to do was take care of myself.</p> 
            <p>Antidepressants aren't really a solution. Counseling isn't a resource with wide availability. Even the Army says that they don't know how to "unprogram" you. But where does that leave me?"</p>
