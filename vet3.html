            <p>"I was working at a car dealership a few years back when a man said to me, "Muhammad? I would never buy a car from a Muslim. A Muslim and a n****r. Never." But when he heard someone else calling me "Big Sarge" he apologized. Wow. Everyone in this country has respect for veterans. But no one really knows what it's like out here. </p>
            <p>I was doing pretty well for a while. I had a nice job and a girlfriend. We were beginning to settle down. I even bought a Mercedes. But my PTSD was always there. So things started changing.</p>
            <p>I started getting fired a lot. I have mood swings because of my PTSD. I didn't work well under a boss. I didn't work too well at home either. Some days, my wife and kid would be scared to talk to me or even be around me. I'd just be angry. I can't control it. When I'm sleeping my wife's scared to be in the same room as me. I have nightmares.</p>
            <p>Now my wife and I are separated. Soon to be divorced. I don't really blame her; I understand it's hard to be around me sometimes. So now I'm trying to find work so I can have a place to sleep and maybe some dental care but it's hard. I have issues with my back so I can't walk well all of the time. I get medication from the VA but they're too much to deal with sometimes. Sometimes I have to ration it when I'm running out.</p>
            <p>People look at me now, homeless and divorced, looking for a job, and they say wow. "You used to drive a Mercedes! What happened?" It's hard to have your voice heard out here, man. Nobody wants to listen. A lot of people think that everyone in the homeless shelters and soup kitchens are there because they made a lot of bad choices. And that's true for some people. But when you put your life on the line for your country overseas, and you come home and end up like me, you gotta wonder what's wrong."</p>
