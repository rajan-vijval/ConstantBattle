            <p>"I grew up in New Hampshire. I wanted to get out but didn't think I had the grades to go to college. I volunteered to go to the military. I chose to be a medic, in hopes of having a useful skill for when I got out of the service. I was soon discharged; however, for being "incompatible with the workings of the military." I was drinking, and doing some other bad stuff.</p>
            <p>I got out and didn't do much of anything. I was drinking and was homeless for a long time. I worked small and meaningless jobs. This was back in the 70s and 80s. Back then, people didn't realize the connection between mental health issues and substance abuse. It wasn't really until around 1990 until I had help with substance abuse. I found out I had an undiagnosed mental health problem.</p>
            <p>Then back in 2013, I was diagnosed with tuberculosis. I went to the VA in Dallas, and it was an interesting experience. They gave me improper medication, and had some other unsavory things going on. There weren't many doctors there, just nurses who would report to doctors. And they'd constantly switch out the nurses, every 6 months or so, not allowing us to develop relationships with these people. Why would a guy open up to a someone when he knows that he/she is going to leave in a few months?</p>
            <p>One thing I can give the VA credit for is helping me out when I was homeless. I went to them and told them my situation, and they assigned me a social worker, looked through nearby places, and got me here. I get a bed, three hot meals, and counseling. I just have to remain sober. I've been here for a few months, and have been participating in compensated work therapy. It's structured and helps gives me skills for when I'm looking for a job when my time here runs out."</p>
